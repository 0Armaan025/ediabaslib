# Global settings
This page allows to change some global app settings.  
* Bluetooth enable options:
  * _Ask for Bluetooth enable_: Ask every time if Bluetooth should be enabled.
  * _Always enable Bluetooth without request_: Always enable Bluetooth, never ask.
  * _No automatic Bluetooth handling_: Bluetooth must be enabled manually.
* Bluetooth disable options:
  * _Disable Bluetooth at exit, if unused and enabled by app_: At app exit disable Bluetooth if the app has enabled it.  
  If the Bluetooth connection is in use for other services it will not be disabled.
* Data logging options:
  * _Store log data settings_: Store log data settings (not trace seetings) from the main menu and restore them an app restart.
* Storage media options:
  * _Default or storage location_: If the default storage media for the ECU files is not appropriate, a different media could be selected here.  
  The application storage directory on the media will be always fixed to _de.holeschak.bmw_deep_obd_.
